# Network Performance and Transmission Impairments

**Network Performance** refers to the efficiency of a network, which is typically evaluated using several metrics:

1. **Throughput**: The rate at which data is successfully transferred from one point to another, usually measured in bits per second (bps). Higher throughput indicates better performance.
  
2. **Latency (Delay)**: The time it takes for data to travel from the source to the destination, usually measured in milliseconds (ms). It is affected by propagation delay, transmission time, and queuing delay.

3. **Bandwidth**: The maximum rate of data transfer across a given path, usually measured in bps. Higher bandwidth indicates a larger capacity to carry data.

4. **Jitter**: The variation in packet arrival time, which affects the quality of real-time applications like video conferencing. Low jitter is desirable.

5. **Packet Loss**: The percentage of packets that are lost during transmission. Packet loss can degrade network performance and impact data integrity.

**Transmission Impairments** refer to factors that can degrade the quality of signals transmitted across the network:

1. **Attenuation**: The weakening of signal strength as it travels through a medium. Amplifiers or repeaters are used to counteract attenuation.

2. **Noise**: Unwanted electrical signals that interfere with data transmission. **Thermal noise**, **crosstalk**, and **impulse noise** are common types of noise that can affect signal quality.

3. **Distortion**: Changes in the shape of a signal, which occur due to the differing propagation speeds of different frequency components in the signal. **Delay distortion** is a common type that impacts digital communication.

4. **Signal Interference**: Overlapping signals from other sources can cause interference, reducing the quality of communication. Wireless signals are especially prone to interference from other wireless devices.

### Switching Techniques and Multiplexing

**Switching Techniques** are methods used to route data from the source to the destination efficiently. There are three primary switching techniques:

1. **Circuit Switching**:
   - **Description**: A dedicated communication path is established between two nodes before data is transmitted. This path remains reserved for the entire session.
   - **Advantages**: Guaranteed bandwidth, suitable for real-time applications like voice calls.
   - **Disadvantages**: Inefficient for data communication, as the channel remains reserved even during idle times.
   - **Example**: Traditional telephone networks.

2. **Packet Switching**:
   - **Description**: Data is divided into packets, which are routed independently to the destination. Each packet may take a different route.
   - **Advantages**: Efficient use of network resources, suitable for data communication and the Internet.
   - **Disadvantages**: Variable delay (latency), which can impact real-time applications.
   - **Example**: The Internet, email, and instant messaging.

3. **Message Switching**:
   - **Description**: Similar to packet switching, but entire messages are sent to intermediate nodes, stored, and then forwarded to the next node.
   - **Advantages**: Efficient when the entire message needs to be transmitted without splitting.
   - **Disadvantages**: Increased delay due to storage at intermediate nodes, making it unsuitable for real-time applications.
   - **Example**: Early telegraph and postal systems.

**Multiplexing** is a technique used to combine multiple signals into one signal over a shared medium:

1. **Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)**:
   - **Description**: Divides the available bandwidth into several frequency bands, each carrying a separate signal.
   - **Use Cases**: Radio broadcasting, cable television.

2. **Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)**:
   - **Description**: Allocates a fixed time slot for each signal in a repeating cycle.
   - **Types**: 
     - **Synchronous TDM**: Each channel is assigned a time slot regardless of whether it has data to send.
     - **Statistical TDM**: Time slots are assigned dynamically based on demand.
   - **Use Cases**: Telephone networks.

3. **Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)**:
   - **Description**: Used in fiber optic communication, where multiple signals are transmitted using different wavelengths of light.
   - **Use Cases**: High-speed data transmission over fiber optic cables.

4. **Code Division Multiplexing (CDM)**:
   - **Description**: Uses unique codes to allow multiple signals to be transmitted simultaneously over the same frequency band.
