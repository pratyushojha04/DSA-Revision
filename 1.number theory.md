### 1. **Check if a Number is Prime**

A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

#### Problem:
Write a function to check whether a given number is prime or not.

#### Approach:
- Any number less than 2 is not prime.
- For a number `n`, check if it is divisible by any number from `2` to `sqrt(n)`. If divisible, it's not prime.

#### Code:
```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Test the function
num = 29
if is_prime(num):
    print(f"{num} is a prime number")
else:
    print(f"{num} is not a prime number")
```

**Explanation:**
- The function iterates through numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`.
- If any number divides `n` without leaving a remainder, `n` is not prime.

### 2. **Find GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) using Euclidean Algorithm**

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them.

#### Problem:
Write a function to find the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean Algorithm.

#### Approach:
The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers `a` and `b` is the same as the GCD of `b` and `a % b`, where `%` is the modulus operator. The algorithm continues until `b` becomes 0.

#### Code:
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Test the function
a = 48
b = 18
result = gcd(a, b)
print(f"GCD of {a} and {b} is {result}")
```

**Explanation:**
- The function swaps `a` and `b` repeatedly, assigning `b` to `a` and `a % b` to `b`.
- Once `b` becomes 0, `a` is the GCD.

---

### 3. **Find LCM (Least Common Multiple)**

The least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest number that is divisible by both.

#### Problem:
Write a function to find the LCM of two numbers.

#### Approach:
The formula to find the LCM is:
\[
\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
\]

#### Code:
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)

# Test the function
a = 12
b = 18
result = lcm(a, b)
print(f"LCM of {a} and {b} is {result}")
```

**Explanation:**
- The LCM is computed by multiplying `a` and `b` and dividing by their GCD.
- This ensures the smallest number that both `a` and `b` divide evenly into.

---

### 4. **Check if a Number is Armstrong Number**

An Armstrong number (also known as a Narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

#### Problem:
Write a function to check whether a number is an Armstrong number.

#### Approach:
- First, count the number of digits in the number.
- Sum the digits raised to the power of the total number of digits.
- If the sum is equal to the original number, it is an Armstrong number.

#### Code:
```python
def is_armstrong(num):
    # Convert the number to string to easily iterate over digits
    digits = list(map(int, str(num)))
    num_digits = len(digits)
    # Calculate the sum of each digit raised to the power of num_digits
    total = sum(digit ** num_digits for digit in digits)
    return total == num

# Test the function
num = 153
if is_armstrong(num):
    print(f"{num} is an Armstrong number")
else:
    print(f"{num} is not an Armstrong number")
```

**Explanation:**
- The function converts the number to a string to access its digits.
- It then calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the total number of digits.
- If the sum equals the original number, it is an Armstrong number.

---

### 5. **Check if a Number is Perfect**

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself).

#### Problem:
Write a function to check whether a number is a perfect number.

#### Approach:
- Find all divisors of the number excluding itself.
- Sum the divisors and check if the sum equals the original number.

#### Code:
```python
def is_perfect(n):
    divisors_sum = sum(i for i in range(1, n) if n % i == 0)
    return divisors_sum == n

# Test the function
num = 28
if is_perfect(num):
    print(f"{num} is a perfect number")
else:
    print(f"{num} is not a perfect number")
```

**Explanation:**
- The function calculates the sum of all divisors of `n` by checking which numbers divide `n` without leaving a remainder.
- If the sum equals `n`, the number is perfect.

---

### 6. **Check if a Number is Fibonacci**

A Fibonacci number is a number that appears in the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

#### Problem:
Write a function to check whether a number is a Fibonacci number.

#### Approach:
A number is Fibonacci if one or both of (5*n^2 + 4) or (5*n^2 - 4) is a perfect square.

#### Code:
```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(x):
    s = int(math.sqrt(x))
    return s * s == x

def is_fibonacci(n):
    return is_perfect_square(5 * n * n + 4) or is_perfect_square(5 * n * n - 4)

# Test the function
num = 21
if is_fibonacci(num):
    print(f"{num} is a Fibonacci number")
else:
    print(f"{num} is not a Fibonacci number")
```

**Explanation:**
- The function checks whether `5*n^2 + 4` or `5*n^2 - 4` is a perfect square, which indicates whether `n` is a Fibonacci number.

---

### 7. **Sum of Digits of a Number**

#### Problem:
Write a function to calculate the sum of the digits of a number.

#### Code:
```python
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

# Test the function
num = 12345
result = sum_of_digits(num)
print(f"Sum of digits of {num} is {result}")
```

**Explanation:**
- The function converts the number to a string and sums its digits.

---

### 8. **Sieve of Eratosthenes for Prime Numbers**

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a given limit.

#### Problem:
Write a function to find all primes up to a given number using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

#### Approach:
- Mark all numbers as prime.
- Starting from 2, mark all multiples of each prime as non-prime.
- Continue until you reach the square root of the number.

#### Code:
```python
def sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit):
    primes = [True] * (limit + 1)
    p = 2
    while p * p <= limit:
        if primes[p]:
            for i in range(p * p, limit + 1, p):
                primes[i] = False
        p += 1
    return [p for p in range(2, limit + 1) if primes[p]]

# Test the function
limit = 50
result = sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit)
print(f"Primes up to {limit}: {result}")
```

**Explanation:**
- The algorithm marks multiples of each number starting from 2 as non-prime.
- The remaining numbers are prime.

# Medium

Certainly! Here are some interesting number theory and math problems along with detailed solutions. These problems cover a range of concepts, including prime numbers, modular arithmetic, combinatorics, and more.

---

### 1. **Find the Sum of the First N Prime Numbers**

#### Problem:
Write a function to find the sum of the first `N` prime numbers.

#### Approach:
- Use a helper function to check if a number is prime.
- Use a loop to find the first `N` primes and sum them up.

#### Code:
```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def sum_of_first_n_primes(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    total_sum = 0
    while count < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            total_sum += num
            count += 1
        num += 1
    return total_sum

# Test the function
n = 5
print(f"Sum of the first {n} prime numbers is {sum_of_first_n_primes(n)}")
```

**Explanation:**
- `is_prime(num)` checks if a number is prime.
- `sum_of_first_n_primes(n)` finds the first `n` primes and calculates their sum.

---

### 2. **Modular Exponentiation**

#### Problem:
Calculate \((base^{exp}) \mod mod\) efficiently.

#### Approach:
- Use modular exponentiation to compute the result in \(O(\log \text{exp})\) time.

#### Code:
```python
def modular_exponentiation(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    base = base % mod
    while exp > 0:
        if (exp % 2) == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        exp = exp >> 1
        base = (base * base) % mod
    return result

# Test the function
base = 2
exp = 10
mod = 1000
print(f"({base}^{exp}) % {mod} = {modular_exponentiation(base, exp, mod)}")
```

**Explanation:**
- The function uses an iterative approach to reduce the exponent by half in each step while squaring the base and applying the modulus.

---

### 3. **Find the Number of Divisors**

#### Problem:
Write a function to find the number of divisors of a given number.

#### Approach:
- Iterate from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\) and count the divisors.

#### Code:
```python
import math

def count_divisors(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if n // i == i:
                count += 1
            else:
                count += 2
    return count

# Test the function
num = 28
print(f"Number of divisors of {num} is {count_divisors(num)}")
```

**Explanation:**
- For each divisor `i` of `n`, there is a corresponding divisor `n // i`.
- If `i` is the square root of `n`, count it once, otherwise count both `i` and `n // i`.

---

### 4. **Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm**

#### Problem:
Compute the GCD of two numbers and find coefficients `x` and `y` such that \(a \cdot x + b \cdot y = \text{GCD}(a, b)\).

#### Approach:
- Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to compute GCD and coefficients.

#### Code:
```python
def extended_gcd(a, b):
    if a == 0:
        return (b, 0, 1)
    gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b % a, a)
    x = y1 - (b // a) * x1
    y = x1
    return gcd, x, y

# Test the function
a = 56
b = 98
gcd, x, y = extended_gcd(a, b)
print(f"GCD of {a} and {b} is {gcd}")
print(f"Coefficients x and y are {x} and {y}, respectively")
```

**Explanation:**
- The function recursively computes the GCD and coefficients using the extended Euclidean algorithm.

---

### 5. **Find the Number of Solutions to a Linear Diophantine Equation**

#### Problem:
Find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \(ax + by = c\).

#### Approach:
- Use the fact that the number of solutions depends on whether \(c\) is divisible by the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).

#### Code:
```python
def count_solutions(a, b, c):
    def gcd(x, y):
        while y:
            x, y = y, x % y
        return x

    if c % gcd(a, b) != 0:
        return 0

    # Count the number of solutions
    x0 = 0
    y0 = 0
    gcd, x0, y0 = extended_gcd(a, b)
    
    x0 *= c // gcd
    y0 *= c // gcd

    # Find bounds for x and y
    count = 0
    while x0 <= c:
        count += 1
        x0 += b
    return count

# Test the function
a = 4
b = 5
c = 12
print(f"Number of solutions to {a}x + {b}y = {c} is {count_solutions(a, b, c)}")
```

**Explanation:**
- The function first checks if `c` is divisible by the GCD of `a` and `b`.
- It then calculates the bounds and counts the number of solutions.

#### Code:
```python
def modular_inverse(a, m):
    gcd, x, _ = extended_gcd(a, m)
    if gcd != 1:
        raise ValueError("No modular inverse exists")
    return x % m

# Test the function
a = 3
m = 11
inverse = modular_inverse(a, m)
print(f"Modular inverse of {a} mod {m} is {inverse}")
```

**Explanation:**
- The function uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse.
- If `gcd` is not 1, the inverse does not exist.

---

    while power:
        if power % 2:
            result = matrix_mult(result, base)
        base = matrix_mult(base, base)
        power //= 2
    return result

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    F = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 0]])

    for p in primes:
        if (p + 6) in prime_set and (p + 12) in prime_set:
            triplets.append((p, p + 6, p + 12))
    
    return triplets

# Test the function
N = 50
print(f"Prime triplets less than {N} are: {find_prime_triplets(N)}")
```

**Explanation:**

    gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b % a, a)
    x = y1 - (b // a) * x1
    y = x1
    return gcd, x, y

def find_diophantine_solutions(a, b, c):
    gcd, x0, y0 = extended_gcd(a, b)
    if c % gcd != 0:
        return []
    
    x0 *= c // gcd
    y0 *= c // gcd
    
    # The number of solutions is infinite; find general solutions
    x_solutions = []
    for k in range(-10, 10):  # Example range, adjust as needed
        x_solutions.append((x0 + k * (b // gcd), y0 - k * (a // gcd)))
